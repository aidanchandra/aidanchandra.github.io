## Welcome to my personal website! 
This site is just a collection of blog posts about various happenings and projects that I'm involved in.
### About Me:
I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University, earning my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and a minor in United States History. My freshman year was interrupted by the pandemic, so I took a gap year. I'm now graduating in 2024.
I plan to pursue my Masters in Computer Science here at Stanford and hope to graduate in 2025 with my M.A. in CS.
